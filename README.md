# Hi there 👋
## ❓About Me
I'm a computer engineering 4th-grade student. I improve myself on the backend development.
## 🔻Programming Languages That I Use
- C++
- C#
- Python
- Dart
## :hurtrealbad:My Experiences
- My first "*real*" product was an API that written in Python. A start-up company has used my product for a time. That wasn't perfect but it was glorious! I was an intern at that time and I don't even don't know what Python is. And I wasn't in a team Skyler, **I was the team**.
- Many people came to me for help and because of that I have to learn Unity and made a simple puzzle game, programming a embedded system for a robotic leg(?) and mobile application that was written in Dart, Flutter for controlling that robotic leg via mobile app etc.
- Also I've worked on many things but those are half-finished-dead projects and if you are interested what they are you can check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yi%C4%9Fit-leblebicier-0bb2601b6/) account!

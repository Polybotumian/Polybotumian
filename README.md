# Hi there 👋
## ❓About Me
I'm a 4th year computer engineering student. I am improving myself on the backend development.
## 🔻Programming Languages That I Use
- C++
- C#
- Python
- Dart
## :hurtrealbad:My Experiences
- My first "*real*" product was an API written in Python. A start-up company used my product for a while. It wasn't perfect, but it was glorious! I was an intern at the time and didn't even know what Python was. And I wasn't on a team, Skyler, **I was the team**.
- A lot of people came to me for help, so I had to learn Unity and made a simple puzzle game, programmed an embedded system for a robotic leg(?) and a mobile application written in Dart, Flutter to control the robotic leg via a mobile app, etc.
- I've also worked on many things, but those are half-finished dead projects and if you're interested in what they are, you can check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yi%C4%9Fit-leblebicier-0bb2601b6/) account!
